# finstagram

Originally a homework assignment for my web design class, Finstagram is a front-end for a mock version of an Instagram profile. The original assignment was an exercise in CSS positioning properties. In this new version, I extended the original's functionality by introducing a lightbox feature where a full-sized preview alongside a caption appears in the middle of the screen after an image is clicked. On top of that, I added responsiveness through the use of media queries to make the site mobile-friendly.
